# walkshedMap
This is a simple Shiny app that utilizes Walkscore APIs to display information based on user input. 

To use this shiny app on your own shiny server, you must edit the server-public.R file to include your own Walkscore API key (get key here: https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php) and then rename the file to 'server.R'.
